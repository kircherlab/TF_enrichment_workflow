# Transcriptionfactors

This folder should contain all transcriptionfactors with their binding sites that will be used in the workflow. This worklow was designed and only used with the predicted TFBS of the JASPAR Core Collection. They can be downloaded by executing the following command:

```bash
wget -r -nd -A .tsv.gz http://expdata.cmmt.ubc.ca/JASPAR/downloads/UCSC_tracks/2020/hg38/
```

**Attention:** downloading all transcription factors will need a lot of free disk space.
